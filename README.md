# Welcome to [Repository Name] 🚀

This repository accompanies the paper **"[Paper Title]"**, presenting all analyses conducted as part of the study. Our work focuses on [brief description, e.g., "the spatial transcriptomics of ileal tissue in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using Xenium technology."] 

## 🌟 About the Study

### 🧪 Objective  
To [main goal, e.g., "identify spatial gene expression patterns in ileal tissue and uncover potential biomarkers for IBD."]

### 🔬 Techniques  
We utilized:  
- **Xenium Spatial Transcriptomics**: To map gene expression at single-cell resolution.  
- **Computational Integration**: Using Harmony for batch correction and multi-sample integration.  
- **Custom Quality Control Pipelines**: Filtering out outliers and assessing negative probe performance.  

### 📊 Dataset  
- **Samples**: 40 ileal tissue samples  
- **Cells**: Over 3 million cells analyzed  
- **Genes**: 422 genes profiled  

## 📂 Repository Contents

Here’s what you’ll find:
