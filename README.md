This repository accompanies the paper **"Single-cell multiomics identifies unique features of immune dysfunction in the colon, blood and stool from individuals diagnosed with Parkinsonâ€™s disease or Inflammatory bowel disease"**, presenting all analyses conducted as part of the study. Our work focuses on the relationship between Parkinson Disease(PD) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). 

### ðŸ”¬ Techniques  
We worked with Spatial Transcriptomics, and we utilized:  

- **Custom R pipelines** 
- **Custom Python pipelines**

### ðŸ“Š Dataset  

- **Single-cell multiomic spatial imaging (via NanoString CosMxTM) of colonic tissue**: CosMx RNA and CosMx protein.
- **Akoya proteomics**
